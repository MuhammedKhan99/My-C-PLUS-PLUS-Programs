 DOCUMENTATION
 
 Program Purpose:

 Create a simple class (DoStuff) containing an int, and overload the operator+ as a member function. 
 Also, provide a print() member function that takes an ostream& as an argument and prints to that ostream&. 
 Add a binary operator- and operator+ to the class as member functions. 
You should be able to use the objects in complex expressions such as a + b â€“ c. 
Now add the operator++ and operator--, 
both prefix and postfix versions. Overload the << operator to provide the same functionality as the print() member function. 
Test the class to show that all requirements work correctly. 
 	

 Compile (assuming Cygwin is running): g++ -o TMA3Q3 TMA3Q3.cpp
 Execution (assuming Cygwin is running): ./TMA3Q3.exe
 
 
 
 Classes: Do Stuff.

 Variables:

 int i  : DoStuff object variable to store int.
  a ,b , c ,d ,f e, , l ,n : Do stuff objects.

TEST PLAN
Normal Case : (All functions have been overloaded succesfully.)

a = 1
This is the overloaded  operator<< function.
b = 2
This is the overloaded  operator<< function.
c = 4
This is the overloaded  operator<< function.
 3
 This is the print function.
 -1
 This is the print function.
 6
 This is the print function.
 20
 This is the print function.
 44
 This is the print function.
e = 3
This is the overloaded  operator<< function.
g = -1
This is the overloaded  operator<< function.
 l = 20
This is the overloaded  operator<< function.
n = 44
This is the overloaded  operator<< function.
